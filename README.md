# Home_Sales Module 22 challenge

This code is an analysis of a PySpark script that performs various data processing tasks using Spark SQL. Here's a step-by-step analysis of each part of the code:

Import Libraries: The code starts by importing the necessary libraries, including findspark for initializing Spark in a Jupyter notebook-like environment and other PySpark and Python libraries like SparkSession and time.
Initialize Spark: It initializes a SparkSession named "SparkSQL" running on the local machine with all available CPU cores ("local[*]").
Data Loading: It reads a CSV file named "home_sales_revised.csv" into a Spark DataFrame called spark_df. This DataFrame will be used for various data analysis tasks.
Creating Temporary Views: The script creates a temporary view called "home_sales" for the DataFrame spark_df. This allows you to run SQL queries on the data.
Query 1: It calculates the average price for four-bedroom houses sold in each year and rounds the result to two decimal places. The result is displayed using the show method.
Query 2: Similar to Query 1, it calculates the average price of homes with three bedrooms and three bathrooms for each year and rounds the result to two decimal places.
Query 3: Calculates the average price of homes with three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and a living area of at least 2000 square feet for each year.
Query 4: Calculates the "view" rating for the average price of homes with a price greater than or equal to $350,000. It also measures the runtime of this query using the time library.
Caching: The script caches the "home_sales" table, making it available for faster queries.
Checking Cache: It checks if the "home_sales" table is cached and prints the result.
Query 5 (Using Cached Data): It reruns the query from step 4 using the cached data and measures the runtime.
Partitioning Data: It saves the DataFrame spark_df in Parquet format, partitioned by the "date_built" field.
Reading Parquet Data: Reads the Parquet data stored in the "partitioned_home_sales.parquet" directory and merges it into a single DataFrame. This part of the code could be more efficient if you used Spark's built-in partitioning.
Creating Temporary Table for Parquet Data: Creates a temporary view called "partitioned_home_sales" for the merged DataFrame.
Query 6 (Parquet Data): It reruns the query from step 4 using the Parquet data and measures the runtime. The comment suggests that this approach may not be as optimized as using Spark's native partitioning.
Uncaching Data: The script un-caches the "home_sales" table.
Checking Cache: It checks if the "home_sales" table is no longer cached and prints the result.
Spark Stop: Finally, it stops the SparkSession to release resources.
Overall, this code demonstrates various Spark SQL operations, including data loading, caching, partitioning, and querying, and it also measures the runtime for some of the queries to compare cached and non-cached data performance.
